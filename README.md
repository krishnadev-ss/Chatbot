# Chatbot Project

A simple chatbot built using TensorFlow and NLTK that can understand user input and respond based on predefined intents.

## Features

- Natural language processing to understand user input.
- Customizable intents and responses.
- Trained on various user phrases to improve accuracy.
- Can be run locally with Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Pickle

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git
   cd chatbot-project
2.Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv chatbot_env
Activate the virtual environment:

3.On Windows:

chatbot_env\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

source chatbot_env/bin/activate
Install the required packages:


pip install tensorflow nltk numpy
Download NLTK resources:

python

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
Usage
Prepare your intents: Create a intents.json file in the project directory with the following structure:


{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "Hello", "Is anyone there?"],
            "responses": ["Hello, how can I help you?"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "goodbye",
            "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
            "responses": ["See you later, thanks for visiting"]
        },
        {
            "tag": "thanks",
            "patterns": ["Thanks", "Thank you", "That's helpful"],
            "responses": ["Happy to help!", "Any time!"]
        }
        // Add more intents as needed
    ]
}
Run the training script:

python train.py
Start the chatbot:


python chatbot.py
Interact with the chatbot: Type a message and press Enter. The bot will respond based on the predefined intents.

Model Training
The model is trained using the following architecture:

Input layer with 128 neurons
Dropout layer
Hidden layer with 64 neurons
Dropout layer
Output layer with softmax activation
Training Data Format
The training data is generated from the intents.json file. Each pattern is tokenized, lemmatized, and converted into a bag-of-words representation.

Customization
Feel free to customize the intents in intents.json and retrain the model to suit your specific needs.
